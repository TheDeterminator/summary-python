interesting happens", "start": 101.03, "duration": 2.61}, {"text": "so that means there are a lot of", "start": 102.32, "duration": 3.51}, {"text": "accidental features and that is very", "start":

worry", "start": 188.6, "duration": 3.27}, {"text": "about is any grid settings so whenever", "start": 189.59, "duration": 4.52}, {"text": "you're adding stuff in PowerPoint", "start": 191.87,

you", "start": 217.099, "duration": 3.03}, {"text": "going to get it like any type of logic", "start": 218.84, "duration": 3.479}, {"text": "at all so the first thing that we can", "start": 220.129, "duration": 5.071}, {"text": "turn to is paper links so if we just", "start": 222.319, "duration": 4.111}, {"text": "right click on something we can add a", "start": 225.2, "duration": 3.84}, {"text": "link and we can play inside of this", "start": 226.43, "duration": 10.559}, {"text": "document and we can right so now we have", "start": 229.04, "duration": 11.069}, {"text": "a very basic sort of

some sequence of", "start": 279.44, "duration": 3.27}, {"text": "characters so in this case it's going to", "start": 280.759, "duration": 2.701}, {"text": "likely step", "start": 282.71, "duration":

and input and it's gonna accept", "start": 288.5, "duration": 4.11}, {"text": "that sequence or you can like go back to", "start": 290.63, "duration": 7.08}, {"text": "the beginning and it's a

that's kind of neat that", "start": 353.27, "duration": 3.5}, {"text": "we could do this without too many slides", "start": 355.43, "duration": 3.75}, {"text": "and that's because there's not very
